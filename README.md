[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/85sag0cap8qyv6s2?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carfup/xtbplugins-deltastepsbetweenenvironments)

This plugin will allow you to compare the same solution on two different environments in order to find out if some plugin steps are missing.
If any are missing then you have the possibility to copy one from one environment to the other (! you need to have the plugin created because being able to copy the step).
